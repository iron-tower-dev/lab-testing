## 3. Technical Architecture Implementation

### 3.1 Angular Architecture ✅

**Implementation Highlights**:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-debris-id-entry-form',
  imports: [SharedModule],
  templateUrl: './debris-id-entry-form.html',
  styleUrl: './debris-id-entry-form.scss'
})
export class DebrisIdEntryForm implements OnInit
```

- **Standalone Component**: Uses latest Angular 20 standalone architecture
- **Input/Output Signals**: Modern signal-based reactive state management
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

### 3.2 Form Management ✅

**Key Features**:
- **Reactive Forms**: `FormBuilder` with nested form structures
- **Form Arrays**: Dynamic particle type forms array for scalability  
- **Validation**: Custom validators with real-time feedback
- **State Management**: Angular signals for reactive UI updates

```typescript
// Form structure example
this.overallForm = this.fb.group({
  analystInitials: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.maxLength(5)]],
  testStandard: ['ASTM-D7670', Validators.required],
  // ... other fields
});

this.particleTypeFormsArray = this.fb.array(
  this.debrisParticleTypes.map(type => this.createParticleTypeForm(type))
);
```

### 3.3 State Management ✅

**Signal-based Reactivity**:
```typescript
viewMode = signal<DebrisIdViewMode>('All');
selectedParticleCount = signal<number>(0);
commentCharacterCount = signal<number>(0);
commentLimitWarning = computed(() => this.commentCharacterCount() > 900);
```

**Benefits**:
- Reactive UI updates without manual change detection
- Computed properties for derived state
- Efficient rendering with minimal DOM updates
