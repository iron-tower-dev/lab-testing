## 3. Technical Architecture Implementation

### 3.1 Angular Architecture ✅

**Modern Angular 20 Features**:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-deleterious-entry-form',
  imports: [SharedModule],
  templateUrl: './deleterious-entry-form.html',
  styleUrl: './deleterious-entry-form.scss'
})
export class DeleteriousEntryForm implements OnInit
```

- **Standalone Component**: No NgModules dependency
- **Input/Output Signals**: Modern reactive programming patterns
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Complete type safety throughout

### 3.2 Reactive Forms Architecture ✅

**Form Structure**:
```typescript
// Main form with nested trials
this.form = this.fb.group({
  analystInitials: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.maxLength(5)]],
  testStandard: ['ASTM-D7216', Validators.required],
  equipment: ['', Validators.required],
  trials: this.trialsFormArray,
  labComments: ['', Validators.maxLength(1000)]
});

// Dynamic trials array
this.trialsFormArray = this.fb.array([
  this.createTrialForm(1),
  this.createTrialForm(2),
  this.createTrialForm(3),
  this.createTrialForm(4)
]);
```

**Benefits**:
- Scalable trial management
- Individual trial validation
- Reactive updates across form hierarchy

### 3.3 Signal-Based State Management ✅

**Reactive State Architecture**:
```typescript
readonly selectedTrialsCount = signal<number>(0);
readonly calculatedResults = signal<{average: number; stdDev: number; cv: number} | null>(null);
readonly hasUnsavedChanges = signal<boolean>(false);

// Computed properties
readonly formIsValid = computed(() => this.form?.valid && this.selectedTrialsCount() > 0);
readonly commentLimitWarning = computed(() => this.commentCharacterCount() > 900);
```

**Advantages**:
- Efficient change detection
- Declarative reactive patterns
- Automatic UI updates

    equipment: string;
  };
  trials: DeleteriousTrial[];
  labComments: string;
  overallResult?: {
    averageValue: number;
    standardDeviation: number;
    coefficientOfVariation: number;
  };
}
```

.trials-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;

  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```
