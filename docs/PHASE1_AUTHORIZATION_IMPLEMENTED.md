## 🎨 UI Enhancements

### Before:
```
[ ] Test A
[ ] Test B
[ ] Test C
```

### After:
```
[ ] Test A            [Qualified] ✓
[🔒] Test B           [Not Qualified] ✗
[ ] Test C            [Trainee] ⚠️
```

---

## 🔐 Authorization Flow

```
1. User navigates to /enter-results
   ↓
2. qualificationGuard executes
   ↓
3. Load user qualifications (if not loaded)
   ↓
4. Check test stand ID (if provided)
   ↓
5. Allow/Deny access
   ↓
6. Component loads qualifications
   ↓
7. Test list shows badges
   ↓
8. User selects test
   ↓
9. Verify qualification
   ↓
10. Allow/Deny test entry
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Setup Test Data

**1. Create sample qualifications in database:**

```bash
# Run migration (if not already done)
sqlite3 lab.db < drizzle/0001_phase1_critical_tables.sql

# Run seeder to create sample data
npm run seed
```

**2. Set current user in browser:**

Open browser console and run:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('currentUser', JSON.stringify({
  employeeId: 'EMP001',
  name: 'Test User'
}));
```

---

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Qualified User (Q Level)
**Setup:**
```sql
INSERT INTO lube_tech_qualification_table 
(employeeId, testStandId, qualificationLevel, certifiedDate, active)
VALUES ('EMP001', 1, 'Q', unixepoch('now'), 1);
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Test shows green "Qualified" badge
- ✅ User can select test
- ✅ Test entry form loads
- ✅ Can save results

---

#### Scenario 2: Trainee User (TRAIN Level)
**Setup:**
```sql
UPDATE lube_tech_qualification_table 
SET qualificationLevel = 'TRAIN'
WHERE employeeId = 'EMP001';
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ⚠️ Test shows orange "Trainee" badge
- ✅ User can select test
- ✅ Test entry form loads
- ℹ️ Results saved with "T" status (needs review)

---

#### Scenario 3: Not Qualified
**Setup:**
```sql
DELETE FROM lube_tech_qualification_table 
WHERE employeeId = 'EMP001' AND testStandId = 1;
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- 🔴 Test shows red "Not Qualified" badge
- 🔒 Lock icon appears
- ❌ Test is disabled (grayed out)
- ❌ Cannot click to select

---

#### Scenario 4: Expired Qualification
**Setup:**
```sql
INSERT INTO lube_tech_qualification_table 
(employeeId, testStandId, qualificationLevel, certifiedDate, expirationDate, active)
VALUES ('EMP001', 1, 'Q', unixepoch('2024-01-01'), unixepoch('2024-12-31'), 1);
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- 🔴 Test shows red badge
- ⚠️ "Expired" warning appears
- ❌ Cannot select test

---

#### Scenario 5: QAG User (Reviewer)
**Setup:**
```sql
UPDATE lube_tech_qualification_table 
SET qualificationLevel = 'QAG'
WHERE employeeId = 'EMP001';
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- 🔵 Test shows blue "QA Qualified" badge
- ✅ Can enter results
- ✅ Can review others' results
- ✅ Can approve/reject

---

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to enter-results:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4200/enter-results
   ```

3. **Verify loading indicator appears** (briefly)

4. **Check test list:**
   - [ ] Badges appear next to test names
   - [ ] Colors match qualification levels
   - [ ] Lock icons appear for unauthorized tests
   - [ ] Authorized tests are clickable
   - [ ] Unauthorized tests are grayed out

5. **Try to select authorized test:**
   - [ ] Test selection works
   - [ ] Sample panel appears
   - [ ] No errors in console

6. **Try to click unauthorized test:**
   - [ ] Nothing happens
   - [ ] Cursor shows "not-allowed"
   - [ ] Test remains unselected

7. **Check browser console:**
   - [ ] "User qualifications loaded successfully" message
   - [ ] No errors

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No badges appear
**Solution:**
- Check that API server is running (`npm run dev:server`)
- Check that `/api/qualifications` endpoint works
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user ID is set in localStorage

### Issue: All tests show "Not Qualified"
**Solution:**
- Run database seed: `npm run seed`
- Check database has qualification data
- Verify employeeId matches stored user

### Issue: Loading indicator never disappears
**Solution:**
- Check API endpoint is accessible
- Check network tab for failed requests
- Verify QualificationService is loading correctly

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution:**
```bash
npm install
ng build
```

## 📊 Implementation Stats

**Files Created:** 1 (qualification.guard.ts)  
**Files Modified:** 5  
**Lines Added:** ~350  
**Services Used:** QualificationService  
**API Endpoints Used:** `/api/qualifications/:employeeId`

---

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Code

### No Breaking Changes
All changes are **additive** - existing functionality continues to work.

### Backward Compatible
- Tests without testStandId still work
- Component loads even if qualifications fail
- Graceful degradation if API unavailable
