## Quick Start

### 1. Review the Analysis Document
Start by reading the comprehensive analysis:
📄 `docs/ANALYSIS_EnterResults_Comparison.md`

### 2. Start with Gap 1
Read and implement the authorization system first:
📄 `docs/implementation-guides/GAP1_Authorization_Qualification_System.md`

**Key Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Create database schema
# Edit: server/db/schema.ts (add lubeTechQualificationTable)

# 2. Create seed data
# Create: server/db/seeds/lube-tech-qualification.seed.ts

# 3. Create backend API
# Create: server/api/routes/user-qualifications.ts

# 4. Create Angular service
# Create: src/app/services/authorization.service.ts

# 5. Create guard
# Create: src/app/guards/test-authorization.guard.ts

# 6. Create UI components
# Create: src/app/enter-results/components/authorization-badge.component.ts

# 7. Test everything
# Create: src/app/services/authorization.service.spec.ts
```

### 3. Move to Gap 2
After Gap 1 is complete and tested, implement status workflow:
📄 `docs/implementation-guides/GAP2_Status_Workflow_System.md`

---

## Testing Requirements

Each gap implementation must include:

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Error handling tests

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Service unit tests
- [ ] Component unit tests
- [ ] Guard/interceptor tests
- [ ] E2E workflow tests

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Happy path scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases
- [ ] Error scenarios
- [ ] Cross-qualification scenarios
- [ ] Cross-status scenarios

---

## Documentation Requirements

Each implementation must include:

- [ ] **Code Comments** - Inline documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation** - Endpoint specs
- [ ] **User Guide** - How to use the feature
- [ ] **Admin Guide** - How to configure/maintain
- [ ] **Migration Notes** - Changes from legacy system
- [ ] **Known Issues** - Limitations or bugs
- [ ] **Future Enhancements** - Planned improvements

---

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Type Safety
Use TypeScript types and interfaces everywhere:
```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface UserQualification {
  qualificationLevel: QualificationLevel;
}

// ❌ Bad
let userQual = 'QAG'; // string - no type safety
```

### 2. Reactive Patterns
Use Angular signals and observables:
```typescript
// ✅ Good
readonly userQualification = signal<QualificationLevel>(null);

// ❌ Bad
userQualification: string = '';
```

### 3. Component Composition
Build small, reusable components:
```typescript
// ✅ Good
<app-authorization-badge [level]="qualification()" />
<app-status-badge [status]="currentStatus()" />

// ❌ Bad
// One giant component with everything
```

### 4. Service Layer
Business logic in services, not components:
```typescript
// ✅ Good
class AuthorizationService {
  canReviewResult(...): Observable<boolean> { }
}

// ❌ Bad
class MyComponent {
  canReviewResult(): boolean {
    // complex logic in component
  }
}
```

### 5. Testability
Write testable code:
```typescript
// ✅ Good - easy to test
checkQualification(userId: string, testId: number): Observable<Result>

// ❌ Bad - hard to test
checkQualification(): Observable<Result> {
  const userId = this.getCurrentUser(); // hidden dependency
}
```

---

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Run Both Systems in Parallel
- Keep legacy VB.NET ASP running
- Implement Angular features one by one
- Compare results between systems

### Step 2: Feature Flags
```typescript
// Allow gradual rollout
const USE_NEW_AUTH = environment.featureFlags.newAuth;

if (USE_NEW_AUTH) {
  // New Angular implementation
} else {
  // Legacy redirect
}
```

### Step 3: Data Migration
- Export legacy data
- Transform to new schema
- Import to new system
- Validate integrity

### Step 4: User Training
- Document changes
- Create training materials
- Train power users first
- Gather feedback

### Step 5: Full Cutover
- Switch all users to new system
- Monitor for issues
- Keep legacy system for reference
- Archive legacy after 90 days
