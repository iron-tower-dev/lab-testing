# Ferrography Entry Form - View Mode Implementation

## Overview

Updated the ferrography entry form to properly hide non-selected particle types when the "Selected Records (Review)" view mode is chosen. This improvement enhances the user experience by showing only relevant particle types during review workflows.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Template Changes (`ferrography-entry-form.html`)

#### Conditional Rendering
- Wrapped the `app-particle-type-card` with `*ngIf="isParticleTypeVisible(particleType)"` 
- Used `ng-container` to iterate over all particle types while conditionally rendering cards
- This ensures DOM elements are completely removed when not visible, improving performance

```html
<ng-container *ngFor="let particleType of dynamicParticleTypes()">
  <app-particle-type-card
    *ngIf="isParticleTypeVisible(particleType)"
    [particleType]="particleType"
    ...
  >
  </app-particle-type-card>
</ng-container>
```

#### Dynamic Subtitle
- Updated the card subtitle to reflect the current view mode status
- Shows total count in "All" mode
- Shows selected count or helpful message in "Review" mode

```html
<mat-card-subtitle>
  <ng-container *ngIf="viewMode() === 'All'; else reviewModeSubtitle">
    {{ dynamicParticleTypes().length }} particle types loaded from database
  </ng-container>
  <ng-template #reviewModeSubtitle>
    <ng-container *ngIf="getVisibleParticleTypesCount() === 0">
      No particle types selected - please select particle types to view them
    </ng-container>
    <ng-container *ngIf="getVisibleParticleTypesCount() > 0">
      {{ getVisibleParticleTypesCount() }} selected particle types shown
    </ng-container>
  </ng-template>
</mat-card-subtitle>
```

### 2. Component Logic (`ferrography-entry-form.ts`)

#### New Method: `getVisibleParticleTypesCount()`
- Added helper method to count currently visible particle types
- Returns the number of particle types that pass the visibility filter
- Used in the template to provide meaningful feedback to users

```typescript
getVisibleParticleTypesCount(): number {
  const visibility = this.particleTypeVisibility();
  return Object.values(visibility).filter(visible => visible).length;
}
```

#### Existing Logic Enhancement
The existing `updateParticleTypeVisibility()` method already handled the core logic:
- **All Mode**: Shows all particle types (`visibility[type] = true`)
- **Review Mode**: Shows only selected particle types (`visibility[type] = isSelected`)

### 3. Testing

#### Added Test Coverage
- New test case for `getVisibleParticleTypesCount()` method
- Verifies correct counting in both "All" and "Review" modes
- Tests multiple selection scenarios to ensure accuracy

```typescript
it('should count visible particle types correctly', () => {
  // Test All mode - should show all types
  component.overallForm.get('viewMode')?.setValue('All');
  expect(component.getVisibleParticleTypesCount()).toBe(2);
  
  // Test Review mode with selections
  component.toggleParticleTypeSelection('Rubbing Wear (Platelet)');
  component.overallForm.get('viewMode')?.setValue('Review');
  expect(component.getVisibleParticleTypesCount()).toBe(1);
});
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Implementation
- All particle types were always visible regardless of selection status
- Users had to manually identify which particle types were selected
- Review mode was cluttered with irrelevant particle types

### After Implementation
- **All Records Mode**: Shows all particle types (unchanged behavior)
- **Selected Records Mode**: Shows only selected particle types
- Clear visual feedback with dynamic subtitle
- Improved workflow efficiency during review processes
- Better focus on relevant particle types

## Technical Benefits

1. **Performance**: DOM elements for hidden particle types are not rendered
2. **User Focus**: Reduces cognitive load by showing only relevant information
3. **Responsive Design**: Maintains responsive layout with fewer visible cards
4. **Accessibility**: Screen readers only encounter relevant content in Review mode

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Existing particle type selection logic unchanged
- Component inputs/outputs remain the same

## Testing Verification

The implementation has been verified with:
- ✅ Successful build compilation
- ✅ Unit test coverage for new functionality
- ✅ Existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ No TypeScript errors or warnings

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select Particle Types**: Use the checkbox on each particle type card to mark for review
2. **Switch to Review Mode**: Change view mode dropdown from "All Records" to "Selected Records"
3. **Review**: Only selected particle types will be visible
4. **Return to All Mode**: Switch back to see all particle types again

This implementation provides a clean, efficient way to focus on selected particle types during the review workflow while maintaining full functionality in all-records mode.
