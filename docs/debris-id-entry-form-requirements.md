## Implementation Notes

This component represents a specialized form type within the laboratory testing application. Unlike standard trial-based forms (such as D-inch), the Debris Identification form focuses on qualitative analysis and particle type classification rather than numeric measurements and calculations.

The "Special Template" designation indicates this form has unique UI requirements and data structures compared to standard test forms, requiring careful attention to user experience and flexibility in particle type management.
