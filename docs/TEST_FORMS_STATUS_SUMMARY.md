## Critical Missing Features

### 🚨 BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Fix Before Production)

1. **Authorization System** ❌ CRITICAL
   - No qualification checks
   - Anyone can enter any test
   - **Security hole!**
   - Est: 8-12 hours

2. **Status Workflow** ❌ HIGH
   - No entry → review → accept flow
   - No training mode
   - Hardcoded status 'E'
   - Est: 12-16 hours

**Total Critical Fixes:** 20-28 hours

## What's Working Well ✅

- Modern Angular signals architecture
- Real-time calculations with validation
- Beautiful UI/UX with gradient cards
- Data persistence working
- Quality control checks
- Loading/saving states

---

## What's Missing ❌

### System-Level (Affects All Forms)
- ❌ Authorization/qualification checks
- ❌ Status workflow (S/T/P/A/E)
- ❌ CNR (criticality) alerts
- ❌ M&TE calibration warnings (except Vis forms)
- ❌ Microscopy workflow integration
- ❌ Historical data view
- ❌ Delete mode
- ❌ Review/accept/reject UI

### Form-Specific
- ❌ 13 forms not fully modernized
- ❌ Spectroscopy: No ferrography auto-trigger
- ❌ Particle Count: No NAS lookup
- ❌ Multiple forms: No file upload
- ❌ Multiple forms: No microscopy "media ready" status

## Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1: Critical Security (20-28h)
- [ ] Implement QualificationService
- [ ] Add authorization guards
- [ ] Implement StatusWorkflowService
- [ ] Add status badges and transitions

### Week 2-3: Form Completion (40-60h)
- [ ] Modernize TBN, RBOT, Rust (7-10h)
- [ ] Add NAS lookup to Particle Count (6-8h)
- [ ] Complete Spectroscopy forms (12-16h)
- [ ] Complete Debris ID & Deleterious (18-22h)
- [ ] Complete TFOUT, Rheometry, Oil Content, VPR (13-17h)

### Week 4-5: Integration (26-38h)
- [ ] Implement CNR system (6-8h)
- [ ] Complete M&TE tracking (8-10h)
- [ ] Complete microscopy workflow (10-12h)
- [ ] Add historical data view (8-10h)

### Week 6: Admin Features (6-10h)
- [ ] Add delete mode (4-6h)
- [ ] Enhance sample header (2-4h)

**Total: 92-136 hours (12-17 working days)**

## Forms by Complexity

### Simple (1-4 hours each)
- TBN (calculation service needed)
- RBOT (time entry)
- Rust (qualitative rating)
- D-inch (measurement)
- Oil Content (percentage)
- VPR (rating)

### Medium (6-10 hours each)
- Particle Count (NAS lookup)
- Spectroscopy forms (file upload + triggers)
- Inspect Filter (microscopy)
- Deleterious (validation)
- Rheometry (calculations)
- TFOUT (validation)

### Complex (10-12 hours each)
- Debris ID (microscopy workflow)

## Status Legend

- ✅ **DONE** = Fully modernized (signals, calculations, persistence)
- 🟡 **PARTIAL** = UI exists but needs modernization/features
- 🔴 **BASIC** = Minimal implementation, needs major work
