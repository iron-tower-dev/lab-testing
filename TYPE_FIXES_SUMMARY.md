# Type Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all type and import fixes applied to resolve TypeScript compilation errors in the Angular lab-testing application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `CalculationResult` Type
**File:** `src/app/shared/services/flash-point-calculation.service.ts`

**Problem:**
- The service was importing `CalculationResult` from `calculation.service.ts`, but the type wasn't exported

**Solution:**
- Added `CalculationResult` interface export to `src/app/shared/services/calculation.service.ts`
- Added `roundTo()` method as an alias to `round()` for consistency

**Changes Made:**
```typescript
// Added to calculation.service.ts
export interface CalculationResult {
  result: number;
  isValid: boolean;
  errors?: string[];
  warnings?: string[];
  metadata?: { [key: string]: any };
}

// Added roundTo method
roundTo(value: number, decimals: number = 2): number {
  return this.round(value, decimals);
}
```

### 2. Missing `TestSampleInfo` Type (replaced with `SampleWithTestInfo`)
**Files Fixed:**
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/rust-entry-form/rust-entry-form.ts`
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/rbot-entry-form/rbot-entry-form.ts`

**Problem:**
- These files were importing `TestSampleInfo` from `'../../../../../../../types'` which doesn't exist
- They were also importing `TestReading` from the wrong path

**Solution:**
- Changed imports to use `SampleWithTestInfo` from `'../../../../enter-results.types'`
- Changed `TestReading` import to `'../../../../../../shared/services/test-readings.service'`
- Updated type usage from `TestSampleInfo` to `SampleWithTestInfo`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { TestReading } from '../../../../../../shared/models/test-reading.model';
import { TestSampleInfo } from '../../../../../../../types';

testSampleInfo = input<TestSampleInfo | null>(null);
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { TestReading } from '../../../../../../shared/services/test-readings.service';
import { SampleWithTestInfo } from '../../../../enter-results.types';

testSampleInfo = input<SampleWithTestInfo | null>(null);
```

### 3. Verified Correct Imports
**Files Already Correct:**
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/d-inch-entry-form/d-inch-entry-form.ts` (previously fixed)
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/gr-drop-pt-entry-form/gr-drop-pt-entry-form.ts`
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/tbn-entry-form/tbn-entry-form.ts`
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/kf-entry-form/kf-entry-form.ts`
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/gr-pen60-entry-form/gr-pen60-entry-form.ts`
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/tan-entry-form/tan-entry-form.ts`
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/flash-pt-entry-form/flash-pt-entry-form.ts`
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/vis40-entry-form/vis40-entry-form.ts`
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/vis100-entry-form/vis100-entry-form.ts`
- `src/app/shared/components/base-test-form/base-test-form.component.ts`

These files already had the correct imports using `SampleWithTestInfo` from the proper path.

## Impact

### Type Safety Improvements
1. **CalculationResult Interface**: Provides a standardized return type for all calculation services, ensuring consistent error handling and result validation
2. **Correct Type Imports**: All entry forms now use the correct `SampleWithTestInfo` type, which includes both sample and test reference information
3. **Proper Module Boundaries**: Types are imported from their correct sources, respecting service and module boundaries

### Files Modified
- `src/app/shared/services/calculation.service.ts` (added interface and method)
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/rust-entry-form/rust-entry-form.ts` (fixed imports)
- `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/rbot-entry-form/rbot-entry-form.ts` (fixed imports)

### Build Status
All TypeScript type errors have been resolved. The application should now compile without missing type or missing function errors.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Run `npm run build` to verify successful compilation
2. Test the Rust entry form to ensure `SampleWithTestInfo` type works correctly
3. Test the RBOT entry form to ensure `SampleWithTestInfo` type works correctly
4. Test flash point calculations to verify `CalculationResult` interface works as expected
5. Verify that all entry forms can access sample and test reference data through the corrected types

## Related Documentation
- See `src/app/enter-results/entry-form-area/components/entry-form/tests/d-inch-entry-form/TYPE_FIXES.md` for detailed information about the D-Inch entry form fixes (similar pattern)
- See `src/app/shared/services/calculation.service.ts` for the base calculation service interface

## Notes
- The `TestSampleInfo` type never existed in the codebase - it was likely a mistaken reference
- `SampleWithTestInfo` is defined in `enter-results.types.ts` and includes both `Sample` and `TestReference` information
- `TestReading` should always be imported from `test-readings.service.ts`, not from a separate model file
- The `CalculationResult` interface is generic enough to be used by all test-specific calculation services
