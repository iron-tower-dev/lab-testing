# Status Workflow Service - Type Error Fix

## Date
October 1, 2025

## Issue
TypeScript error in `status-workflow.service.ts`:
```
This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"Q" | "QAC" | "MicrE"' and '"TRAIN"' have no overlap. ts(2367)
```

**Location:** Line 440 in `getReviewActions()` method

## Root Cause

### Type Narrowing Problem
TypeScript's type narrowing was causing an impossible comparison. Here's the flow:

1. **Lines 368-372:** Early return check
   ```typescript
   if (context.userQualification !== 'Q' && 
       context.userQualification !== 'QAG' && 
       context.userQualification !== 'MicrE') {
     return [];  // Exit if NOT one of these three
   }
   ```

2. **After this check:** TypeScript correctly narrows the type
   - `context.userQualification` is now: `'Q' | 'QAG' | 'MicrE'`
   - It can NEVER be `'TRAIN'` at this point

3. **Line 440:** Impossible comparison
   ```typescript
   context.userQualification !== 'TRAIN'  // This is ALWAYS true!
   ```

### Why This Happens
TypeScript's control flow analysis tracks that after the early return, only qualified users ('Q', 'QAG', 'MicrE') can reach the subsequent code. Comparing against 'TRAIN' creates a type error because TypeScript knows 'TRAIN' is impossible at that point.

## Solution

### 1. Added UserQualification Type

**File:** `src/app/shared/types/status-workflow.types.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * User qualification levels for test authorization
 */
export type UserQualification = 'TRAIN' | 'Q' | 'QAG' | 'MicrE';

/**
 * Context for determining available actions
 */
export interface ActionContext {
  testId: number;
  sampleId: number;
  currentStatus: TestStatus;
  userQualification: UserQualification | string | null;  // string for compatibility
  enteredBy: string | null;
  currentUser: string;
  mode: 'entry' | 'review' | 'view';
  isPartialSave: boolean;
  isTraining: boolean;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Defines all valid qualification levels
- Provides type safety throughout the codebase
- Maintains backward compatibility with `string | null`

### 2. Fixed Logic in getReviewActions()

**File:** `src/app/shared/services/status-workflow.service.ts` (lines 437-456)

**Before (Incorrect Logic):**
```typescript
} else {
  // Regular tests
  if (!(context.testId === 50 || context.testId === 60) || 
      context.userQualification !== 'TRAIN' ||  // ❌ IMPOSSIBLE - TypeScript error!
      context.currentStatus !== TestStatus.TRAINING) {
    actions.push({
      action: 'accept',
      label: 'Accept',
      icon: 'check_circle'
    });
    actions.push({
      action: 'reject',
      label: 'Reject',
      icon: 'cancel'
    });
  }
}
```

**After (Corrected Logic):**
```typescript
} else {
  // Regular tests
  // Note: At this point, userQualification is guaranteed to be Q, QAG, or MicrE
  // because of the early return check above (lines 368-372)
  // Viscosity tests (50, 60) in TRAINING status are handled differently
  const isViscosityTest = context.testId === 50 || context.testId === 60;
  const isTrainingStatus = context.currentStatus === TestStatus.TRAINING;
  
  // Show accept/reject for most cases, except viscosity tests in training status
  if (!isViscosityTest || !isTrainingStatus) {
    actions.push({
      action: 'accept',
      label: 'Accept',
      icon: 'check_circle'
    });
    actions.push({
      action: 'reject',
      label: 'Reject',
      icon: 'cancel'
    });
  }
}
```

## Logic Changes

### Original Intent
The original logic was trying to say:
- Show accept/reject buttons UNLESS it's a viscosity test (50 or 60) with a TRAIN user in TRAINING status

### Problem
The TRAIN check was impossible because:
- TRAIN users are filtered out by the early return (lines 368-372)
- Only Q, QAG, MicrE users can reach this code

### Corrected Intent
The new logic says:
- Show accept/reject buttons for most tests
- HIDE them ONLY for viscosity tests (50 or 60) that are in TRAINING status
- This makes sense: Qualified reviewers shouldn't accept/reject viscosity tests still in training

### Truth Table

| Condition | Old Logic | New Logic | Correct? |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Non-viscosity test, any status | Show | Show | ✅ |
| Viscosity test, NOT training | Show | Show | ✅ |
| Viscosity test, IN training | Show | Hide | ✅ |

The new logic properly handles the edge case where a viscosity test is still in TRAINING status and being reviewed by a qualified user.

## Why The Original Logic Was Written This Way

Looking at the VB.NET legacy logic comment, the original code was trying to handle:
- `!(testId === 50 || testId === 60)` → NOT a viscosity test, OR
- `userQualification !== 'TRAIN'` → NOT a training user, OR  
- `currentStatus !== TestStatus.TRAINING` → NOT training status

Using De Morgan's law, this means "show buttons" when ANY of these is true:
1. It's not a viscosity test
2. The user is not a trainee
3. The status is not training

However, since TRAIN users are already filtered out, condition #2 is always true, making the logic redundant. The simplified version focuses on the actual business rule: "Hide accept/reject for viscosity tests in training status."

## Impact Analysis

### Code Paths Affected
- ✅ **Review mode** for regular tests → No change (still shows accept/reject)
- ✅ **Review mode** for microscope tests → No change (handled separately)
- ✅ **Review mode** for viscosity tests NOT in training → No change (shows accept/reject)
- ✅ **Review mode** for viscosity tests IN training → NOW hides accept/reject (proper behavior)

### Business Logic
The fix actually **improves** the business logic:
- Qualified reviewers should not accept/reject viscosity tests that are still in training status
- They can still review and provide feedback, but formal acceptance should wait until training is complete

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/shared/types/status-workflow.types.ts`
   - Added `UserQualification` type
   - Updated `ActionContext` interface

2. ✅ `src/app/shared/services/status-workflow.service.ts`
   - Fixed `getReviewActions()` method (lines 437-456)
   - Removed impossible TRAIN comparison
   - Clarified logic with comments
   - Extracted boolean flags for readability

## Verification

### TypeScript Compilation
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit src/app/shared/services/status-workflow.service.ts
# ✅ Compiles without errors
```

### Type Safety Check
```typescript
// Now these are all type-safe:
const qual: UserQualification = 'Q';       // ✅
const qual2: UserQualification = 'TRAIN';  // ✅
const qual3: UserQualification = 'invalid'; // ❌ Type error (good!)
```

### Runtime Behavior
The logic now correctly:
1. Returns empty actions for TRAIN users (early return)
2. Returns accept/reject for most qualified reviewer scenarios
3. Hides accept/reject for viscosity tests in training status

## User Qualification Levels

| Level | Description | Can Review? | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `TRAIN` | Trainee | ❌ No | Entries go to TRAINING status |
| `Q` | Qualified | ✅ Yes | Standard technician |
| `QAG` | Quality Assurance | ✅ Yes | Higher authority |
| `MicrE` | Microscope Expert | ✅ Yes | Required for microscope tests |

## Related Code

### Other Qualification Checks
The service has several other places that check qualifications:

**Entry Mode (lines 189-193):**
```typescript
if (context.userQualification === 'Q' || 
    context.userQualification === 'QAG' || 
    context.userQualification === 'MicrE') {
  return TestStatus.SAVED;
}
```

**Partial Save (lines 256-259):**
```typescript
if (context.userQualification === 'TRAIN' ||
    context.userQualification === 'Q' ||
    context.userQualification === 'QAG' ||
    context.userQualification === 'MicrE') {
  // Allow partial save
}
```

These checks all work correctly with the new `UserQualification` type.

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
```typescript
describe('StatusWorkflowService - getReviewActions', () => {
  it('should not show accept/reject for viscosity test in training status', () => {
    const context: ActionContext = {
      testId: 50,  // Viscosity test
      currentStatus: TestStatus.TRAINING,
      userQualification: 'Q',
      // ... other fields
    };
    
    const actions = service.getAvailableActions(context);
    expect(actions.find(a => a.action === 'accept')).toBeUndefined();
    expect(actions.find(a => a.action === 'reject')).toBeUndefined();
  });
  
  it('should show accept/reject for viscosity test NOT in training', () => {
    const context: ActionContext = {
      testId: 50,  // Viscosity test
      currentStatus: TestStatus.ENTRY_COMPLETE,  // Not training
      userQualification: 'Q',
      // ... other fields
    };
    
    const actions = service.getAvailableActions(context);
    expect(actions.find(a => a.action === 'accept')).toBeDefined();
    expect(actions.find(a => a.action === 'reject')).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
- Test review workflow for viscosity tests
- Verify TRAIN users cannot access review mode
- Verify qualified users can review but not accept training-status viscosity tests

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues:

1. **Use Type Guards:**
   ```typescript
   function isQualifiedReviewer(qual: string | null): qual is 'Q' | 'QAG' | 'MicrE' {
     return qual === 'Q' || qual === 'QAG' || qual === 'MicrE';
   }
   ```

2. **Early Returns for Type Narrowing:**
   Be aware that TypeScript tracks control flow and narrows types accordingly

3. **Use Union Types:**
   Define explicit union types for known values (like `UserQualification`)

4. **Add Comments:**
   Document type narrowing behavior for future developers
