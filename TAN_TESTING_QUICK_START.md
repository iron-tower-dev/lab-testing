# TAN Form Testing - Quick Start Guide

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-01  
**Status:** Ready for Testing ✅

## Overview

The TAN form has been integrated with the status workflow system. This document provides a quick-start guide for testing before proceeding with batch integration of the remaining seven forms.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Run Automated Tests

```bash
# From project root
./test-tan-form.sh
```

This will:
- Run all TAN form unit tests
- Check status workflow service tests
- Verify build compiles successfully

### 2. Manual Browser Test

```bash
# Start dev server
ng serve
```

Then navigate to:
1. **Enter Results** module
2. Select a **sample**
3. Choose **TAN test**
4. Observe:
   - ✅ Status badge displays current status
   - ✅ Form loads existing data (if any)
   - ✅ Action buttons appear based on context
   - ✅ Calculations update in real-time

### 3. Core Workflow Test

**Test 1: New Entry (2 min)**
- Enter sample data
- Fill in TAN test fields
- Click "Save"
- Verify status changes to "AWAITING_REVIEW"

**Test 2: Review (2 min)**  
- As different user, view the saved data
- Click "Accept"
- Verify status changes to "ACCEPTED"

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Must-Have Tests (Critical)

- [ ] **Form initializes** without errors
- [ ] **Status badge displays** correctly
- [ ] **Save functionality** works
- [ ] **Data persists** across page refresh
- [ ] **Action buttons** appear based on user/status
- [ ] **Calculations** are accurate
- [ ] **No console errors** in browser DevTools

### Should-Have Tests (Important)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Status doesn't load
**Solution:** Check that the status-transition service endpoint is accessible

### Issue: Save button doesn't work
**Solution:** Verify form validation - check all required fields are filled

### Issue: Tests fail to run
**Solution:** Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

### Issue: Build errors
**Solution:** Check for TypeScript errors with `ng build --configuration=development`

### Issue: Data doesn't persist
**Solution:** Verify backend API is running and accessible
